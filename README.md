# React + Vite With Tailwind

My experience of using react are given below :
-> UseStats :
    React primarily revolves around components, state management, and hooks like useState, useEffect, and more. If "usestats" has emerged as a new concept or library after that date, I would recommend referring to the official React documentation or relevant online resources for the latest information and usage details.
-> UseEffect :
   In React, useEffect is a built-in hook that allows developers to perform side effects in function components. Side effects can include data fetching, DOM manipulation, or subscribing to external data sources. useEffect is commonly used for tasks that need to be performed after the component has rendered and whenever certain dependencies change. It helps manage the component's lifecycle and prevents memory leaks. Developers can specify dependencies to control when the effect runs.

There has some question how can i manage some features in react lets discuss it :

 1. First of all "useStates" gave me a lot if confusion, I had to struggle with which parameters to use when. But i understood that later.
 2. Second, I struggled the most with "useEffect", because it was more difficult than before.  After trying two or three times, I was able to figure it out.  
 3. The third is that there was a problem with all the calculations.  But after a little more thought it became clear.
